NEED AN IMAGE

*NOT NAMED YET*

== TinkerPop 3.4.0

*NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.4.0/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-3-4-0[changelog] for a complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

=== Upgrading for Users

==== Removal of Giraph Support

Support for Giraph has been removed as of this version. There were a number of reasons for this decision which were
discussed in the community prior to taking this step. Users should switch to Spark for their OLAP based graph-computing
needs.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1930[TINKERPOP-1930]

==== Modifications to reducing barrier steps

The behavior of `min()`, `max()`, `mean()` and `sum()` has been modified to return no result if there's no input. Previously these steps yielded the internal seed value:

[source,groovy]
----
gremlin> g.V().values('foo').min()
==>NaN
gremlin> g.V().values('foo').max()
==>NaN
gremlin> g.V().values('foo').mean()
==>NaN
gremlin> g.V().values('foo').sum()
==>0
----

These traversals will no longer emit a result. Note, that this also affects more complex scenarios, e.g. if these steps are used in `by()` modulators:

[source,groovy]
----
gremlin> g.V().group().
......1>   by(label).
......2>   by(outE().values("weight").sum())
==>[software:0,person:3.5]
----

Since software vertices have no outgoing edges and thus no weight values to sum, `software` will no longer show up in the result. In order to get the same result as before, one would
have to add a `coalesce()`-step:

[source,groovy]
----
gremlin> g.V().group().
......1>   by(label).
......2>   by(outE().values("weight").sum())
==>[person:3.5]
gremlin> g.V().group().
......1>   by(label).
......2>   by(coalesce(outE().values("weight"), constant(0)).sum())
==>[software:0,person:3.5]
----

==== Change in order of select() scopes

The order of select scopes has been changed to: maps, side-effects, paths
Previously the order was: side-effects, maps, paths - which made it almost impossible to select a specific map entry if a side-effect with the same name existed.

The following snippets illustrate the changed behavior:

[source,groovy]
----
gremlin> g.V(1).
......1>   group("a").
......2>     by(__.constant("a")).
......3>     by(__.values("name")).
......4>   select("a")
==>[a:marko]
gremlin> g.V(1).
......1>   group("a").
......2>     by(__.constant("a")).
......3>     by(__.values("name")).
......4>   select("a").select("a")
==>[a:marko]
----

Above is the old behavior; the second `select("a")` has no effect, it selects the side-effect `a` again, although one would expect to get the map entry `a`. What follows is the new behavior:

[source,groovy]
----
gremlin> g.V(1).
......1>   group("a").
......2>     by(__.constant("a")).
......3>     by(__.values("name")).
......4>   select("a")
==>[a:marko]
gremlin> g.V(1).
......1>   group("a").
......2>     by(__.constant("a")).
......3>     by(__.values("name")).
......4>   select("a").select("a")
==>marko
----
